The current javascript ecosystem can be difficult to wrap your mind around. This is a simple project which I created to primarily help with two things:

- Learning new ES6 language features
- Learning how to set up and use a more modern javascript development environment

Get started quickly by cloning the repo and then:
* `npm install`
* `npm start -s`

A production build can be generated via:
* `npm run build`
